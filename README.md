========
This was my attempt at a lightweight toml parser for Java.

I have no intention of continuing to develop this. It is not worth the effort.

Instead, please use either:
1. [Configurate](https://github.com/SpongePowered/configurate) - (YAML, HOCON, JSON)
2. [night-config](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/night-config) - (TOML, YAML, HOCON, JSON)
